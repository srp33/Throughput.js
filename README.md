# ToolJig: An app for building simplified Common Workflow Language tool and workflow descriptions

ToolJig is an HTML/CSS/Javascript application that enables researchers to create [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org) (CWL) tool and workflow descriptions in an interactive manner. You can read more about ToolJig and the motivations behind it in our preprint, [Simplifying the development of portable, scalable, and reproducible workflows](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.442204v1).

You can try the app for building CWL tools [here](https://srp33.github.io/ToolJig/tool.html).

You can use the app for building CWL workflows [here](https://srp33.github.io/ToolJig/workflow.html).

You can see example CWL documents in the [examples](https://github.com/srp33/ToolJig/tree/master/examples) directory.
